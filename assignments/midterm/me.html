<h1>Who Am I!</h1>
<p>My name is Semhar Tesfamariam. I am from Eritrea, Eritrea located in east Africa. I moved to united state with my family when I was in junior high school. I went to 
Shorewood high School in Shoreline. After I graduated from Shorewood high School I went to Shoreline and NorthSeattle community college to work on my 
pre Nursing program and graduated in 2018. Seattle is my faviorte state. I think I always say this because of the weather. even though most 
people complain about the rain in Seattle I do love it.
